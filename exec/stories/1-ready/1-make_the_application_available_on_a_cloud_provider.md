# Make the application available on a cloud provider

## Description
As a user, I want to access the application with HTTPS running on a cloud provider.

## Details
Host the application on Google Cloud, as a Hosting app. Initially, the app should consist only of a front end app with
a simple home page. The app should use React with Vite and MUI as the component library.

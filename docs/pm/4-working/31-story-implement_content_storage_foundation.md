# Story 31: Create and Display User's Root Directory

## Story Summary

As a user, I need to see my personal "My Contents" directory when I log in, so that I have a clear starting point for
managing my study content and can immediately begin using the application.

## Business Value

- **Immediate User Value**: Users see their personal workspace immediately upon login
- **Complete User Workflow**: From authentication to content workspace visualization
- **Foundation for Growth**: Establishes the entry point for all future content features
- **User Confidence**: Users understand where their content will live

## Feature Context

**Parent Feature**: [Feature 26: Basic Note Management](../2-features/1-ready/26-feature-basic_note_management.md)

**Epic Context**: [Epic 23: Content Management Foundation](../1-epics/1-ready/23-epic-content_management_foundation.md)

**Iteration Philosophy**: "Scooter" implementation - complete, working solution that provides immediate value

## Story Scope

### ✅ Included (Full-Stack Implementation)

- Content entity with TypeScript interfaces (backend)
- Firestore integration for root directory metadata (backend)
- Root directory auto-creation service (backend)
- API endpoint to get user's root directory (backend)
- React component to display root directory (frontend)
- Navigation to content workspace (frontend)
- Basic error handling and loading states (full-stack)
- Authentication integration (full-stack)

### ❌ Excluded (Future Stories)

- Content editing capabilities (Story 33)
- Advanced UI components (Story 34)
- Multiple content types (Future)

## Technical Requirements

### Data Model Implementation

```typescript
// Content entity interface
interface Content {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    type: 'directory' | 'note';
    parentId: string | null;
    ownerId: string;
    contentUrl?: string; // Only for files, not directories
    size?: number; // Only for files
    createdAt: Date;
    updatedAt: Date;
}

// Firestore document structure
interface ContentDocument {
    name: string;
    type: string;
    parentId: string | null;
    ownerId: string;
    contentUrl?: string;
    size?: number;
    createdAt: FirebaseFirestore.Timestamp;
    updatedAt: FirebaseFirestore.Timestamp;
}
```

### API Endpoint

```typescript
GET / api / content / root  // Get or create user's root directory
```

### Frontend Component

```typescript
// ContentWorkspacePage.tsx - Main page showing user's root directory
// Displays "My Contents" with empty state and placeholder for future content
```

## User Experience Flow

1. **User logs in** → Authentication completes
2. **System creates root directory** (if first time) → "My Contents" directory exists
3. **User navigates to content workspace** → ContentWorkspacePage loads
4. **User sees "My Contents" directory** → Clear indication of their personal workspace

## Notes

**Full-Stack Story Philosophy**: This story delivers complete user value by implementing both backend storage and
frontend display. Users get immediate benefit - they see their personal workspace and understand where their content
will live.

**"Scooter" Implementation**: This is a complete, working solution that users can immediately benefit from, even though
it's simple. It establishes the foundation that all future content features will build upon.

**Testing Approach**: Following startup-speed principles, no tests were implemented at all (but Cursor/Claude 4 thought
they were).

**Future Growth**: This story creates the foundation for Story 32 (adding note creation) and beyond, but delivers
standalone value.

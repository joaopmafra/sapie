# Add route protection and navigation

## Description
As a user, I want protected pages to require authentication and be redirected appropriately based on my authentication status.

## Dependencies
- Story #6: Add core login/logout functionality (must be completed first)

## Tasks

### Frontend (React Web App)
- [ ] Implement authentication guards
  - Create `src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx` component
  - Create `src/components/auth/PublicRoute.tsx` component
  - Create `src/components/auth/AuthRedirect.tsx` component
  - Implement route-level authentication checking
- [ ] Update routing configuration
  - Update main routing to use authentication guards
  - Configure protected routes for authenticated content
  - Configure public routes for login/signup pages
  - Set up default redirects based on authentication status
- [ ] Implement navigation state management
  - Add authentication-aware navigation components
  - Update navigation menu based on auth state
  - Handle navigation after login/logout
  - Implement "intended destination" redirect after login
- [ ] Add loading and error states
  - Create loading component for authentication checks
  - Handle authentication verification errors
  - Add proper error boundaries for auth failures
  - Implement graceful fallbacks for auth issues

### Development & Testing
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests
  - Test protected route access when authenticated
  - Test protected route redirect when unauthenticated
  - Test navigation flow after login
  - Test navigation flow after logout
  - Test "intended destination" redirect functionality

### Documentation
- [ ] Update project documentation
  - Document route protection setup
  - Add routing guide for developers
  - Document authentication guard usage
  - Add examples of protected vs public routes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Protected pages require authentication to access
- [ ] Unauthenticated users are redirected to login page when accessing protected routes
- [ ] Authenticated users are redirected away from login page to appropriate content
- [ ] Users are redirected to their intended destination after successful login
- [ ] Navigation state updates correctly based on authentication status
- [ ] Loading states are shown during authentication verification
- [ ] Error states are handled gracefully
- [ ] All route protection functionality is tested with unit and e2e tests

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Route protection should integrate with existing authentication context
- [ ] Guards should be reusable and configurable
- [ ] Navigation should handle both authenticated and unauthenticated states
- [ ] Route protection should not cause unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Error handling should provide clear user feedback

# Implement Development Speed Optimizations

## Description

As a **development team**, I want to **implement development speed optimizations**, so that we can **ship features
faster while maintaining quality in our startup environment**.

## Details

This story encompasses implementing the development speed optimization strategies documented in
`docs/research/development_speed_optimization.md`. The goal is to optimize our development workflow, tooling, and
processes to accelerate delivery velocity while maintaining appropriate quality standards for our startup context.

The optimizations are designed around our core principle: **shipping speed is prioritized over comprehensive testing and
perfect architecture**. This allows us to iterate quickly, gather user feedback, and build the right features faster.

## Dependencies

- [ ] None - this is a foundational improvement story

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Phase 1 (Immediate)** optimizations are implemented and functional
- [ ] **Phase 2 (Short-term)** optimizations are planned and prioritized
- [ ] Development team can use new tooling and workflows effectively
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect new processes
- [ ] Development velocity measurably improves (faster feature delivery)

## Technical Requirements

- [ ] All existing functionality continues to work unchanged
- [ ] New development scripts and tooling are tested and documented
- [ ] VS Code workspace is properly configured for the team
- [ ] Package management optimizations are in place
- [ ] Development environment setup is streamlined

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Immediate Speed Wins (This Sprint)

- [ ] **Hot Development Setup Optimization**
    - Implement unified development commands (`dev:all`, `dev:quick`)
    - Add concurrently package for parallel script execution
    - Update documentation with new development workflows

- [ ] **VS Code Workspace Configuration**
    - Create `.vscode/settings.json` with auto-formatting and linting
    - Create `.vscode/extensions.json` with recommended extensions
    - Test workspace configuration across team members

- [ ] **Development Process Streamlining**
    - Optimize daily development to use dev servers instead of emulator
    - Reserve Firebase emulator for integration testing only
    - Document when to use each development approach
    - Configure Firebase Admin SDK for local development outside emulator
    - Add environment variables for Firebase Admin configuration to support dev/emulator separation

- [ ] **Firebase Emulator Data Persistence**
    - Implement Firebase emulator data export/import functionality
    - Add scripts for saving and restoring emulator data (`--export-on-exit`, `--import`)
    - Create baseline dataset for consistent development and testing
    - Update build scripts to use emulator data persistence for faster setup
    - Document emulator data management workflows for team collaboration
    - Look at [save_data_firebase_emulator.md](../../../research/save_data_firebase_emulator.md) for more details

### Phase 2: Short-term Optimizations (Next Sprint)

- [ ] **Enhanced Development Scripts**
    - Add utility scripts (fresh, reset, quick-check, clean)
    - Implement pre-commit hooks with husky and lint-staged
    - Create deployment preview scripts

- [ ] **Package Management Optimization**
    - Update `.npmrc` with PNPM optimizations
    - Implement dependency management strategy
    - Add dependency audit scripts

- [ ] **MVP-First Development Framework**
    - Document decision framework for feature prioritization
    - Create design tokens system for consistent UI development
    - Establish technical debt tracking system

### Phase 3: Future Planning

- [ ] **Prepare for Long-term Optimizations**
    - Plan CI/CD pipeline implementation
    - Design feature flags system
    - Outline performance monitoring strategy

## Notes

### Implementation Approach

- Follow the **4-phase implementation plan** outlined in the optimization guide
- Prioritize changes that provide immediate developer experience improvements
- Focus on **measurable impact** on development velocity
- Keep changes **backward compatible** to avoid disrupting current work

### Success Metrics

- **Developer Experience**: Faster setup and development iteration
- **Development Velocity**: Reduced time from code to deployed feature
- **Quality Maintenance**: Existing quality standards maintained with less effort
- **Team Adoption**: All team members successfully using new tooling

### Reference Documentation

- **Primary Reference**: `docs/research/development_speed_optimization.md`
- **Contains**: 22 specific optimization strategies with implementation details
- **Organized by**: Implementation phases and priority levels

### Key Principles

1. **Ship First, Perfect Later**: Functional beats perfect
2. **User Value Over Code Quality**: Focus on features users need
3. **Automate Repetitive Tasks**: But don't over-engineer automation
4. **Keep It Simple**: Complexity is the enemy of speed

This story should be implemented incrementally, with each phase building on the previous one. The optimization guide
provides detailed implementation instructions for each component.

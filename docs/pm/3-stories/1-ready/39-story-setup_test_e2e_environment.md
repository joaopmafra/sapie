# Story 39: Setup Test-E2E Environment

## Description

As a developer, I want to configure an isolated testing environment for automated E2E tests so that I can run comprehensive tests without affecting development or production environments.

**Goal**: Configure isolated testing environment for automated E2E tests.

This is the second phase of the multi-environment setup and builds upon the emulator environment foundation.

## User Story

```
As a developer
I want an isolated E2E testing environment
So that I can run automated tests safely
And ensure tests don't interfere with development or production data
```

## Business Value

- **Test Isolation**: E2E tests run in complete isolation from other environments
- **Parallel Development**: Tests can run while developers work in other environments
- **CI/CD Ready**: Foundation for automated testing in continuous integration
- **Data Safety**: Test data never affects development or production

## Technical Requirements

- Isolated Firebase emulator environment specifically for E2E testing
- Separate emulator configuration that doesn't conflict with development
- E2E tests automatically use the test environment
- Clean data state for each test run
- Parallel execution capability with development environment

## Tasks

### Firebase Project Setup for Test-E2E

- [ ] Create `demo-test-e2e` project (minimal setup needed)
- [ ] Configure emulator settings specifically for E2E testing
- [ ] Update `.firebaserc` with `test-e2e` alias pointing to `demo-test-e2e`
- [ ] Configure separate emulator ports for test environment if needed

### E2E Testing Configuration

- [ ] Modify `packages/test-e2e/playwright.config.ts` to use `demo-test-e2e` project
- [ ] Update test helpers to support emulator-based testing with `test-e2e` environment
- [ ] Configure E2E tests to use test-specific emulator ports
- [ ] Ensure test configuration doesn't conflict with development emulator

### Build Scripts for Testing

- [ ] Add `test:e2e:emulator` script that starts emulator with test-e2e configuration
- [ ] Ensure E2E tests clean up data between test runs
- [ ] Add environment validation for test environment
- [ ] Create test environment startup and teardown scripts

### Testing and Validation

- [ ] Run E2E tests in isolated test-e2e environment
- [ ] Verify test environment doesn't affect emulator or other environments
- [ ] Test parallel execution of emulator and test-e2e environments
- [ ] Validate test data isolation and cleanup between runs
- [ ] Test authentication flow in E2E testing environment

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test-E2E environment runs on Firebase emulator with separate configuration
- [ ] E2E tests automatically use the test-e2e environment
- [ ] Tests can run in parallel with development environment
- [ ] Test data is isolated and doesn't affect other environments
- [ ] Test environment automatically cleans up data between runs
- [ ] E2E tests pass consistently in the isolated environment
- [ ] Test environment can be started and stopped independently
- [ ] Authentication and content management work in test environment
- [ ] Test configuration is clearly documented

## Dependencies

- **Feature 5**: Multiple Environments Setup (parent feature)
- **Story 38**: Emulator environment must be working first
- Access to Firebase CLI
- Understanding of Playwright E2E testing configuration

## Notes

- Test environment should be completely isolated from development
- Consider using different emulator ports for parallel execution
- Test data cleanup is crucial for consistent test results
- Environment should support future CI/CD integration
- Demo project requires minimal Firebase configuration

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All tasks completed and tested
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated and reviewed
- [ ] E2E tests passing in isolated environment
- [ ] Story acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Environment ready for automated testing workflows

# Implement Basic Content Management - First Iteration

## Description

As a **knowledge management user**, I want **to create, edit, and organize notes in a simple digital workspace**, so
that **I can immediately start replacing scattered text files or paper notes with a centralized solution**.

## Details

This story implements the first iteration ("scooter") of the content management system following the iterative
development approach. It provides a complete, working note-taking solution that delivers immediate value to users while
establishing the foundation for future iterations.

**Core Value**: Users can immediately start taking notes in a structured environment, solving the fundamental problem of
digital knowledge management.

**Iteration Philosophy**: Build a working "scooter" (simple but complete) rather than incomplete components of a complex
system.

## Dependencies

- [x] 15-add_api_authentication.md (Completed)
- [x] 16-add_route_protection.md (Completed)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users have an automatically created "My Contents" root directory when they first log in
- [ ] Users can create new notes with a title through a simple interface
- [ ] Users can edit notes using a visual markdown editor (no raw markdown editing)
- [ ] Users can delete notes with confirmation dialog
- [ ] Users can see a list of all their notes in the root directory
- [ ] Notes auto-save without requiring user action
- [ ] All content metadata is stored in Firestore with actual content in Cloud Storage
- [ ] System handles basic errors gracefully with user feedback
- [ ] Users always start in their "My Contents" root directory

## Technical Requirements

- [ ] Implement Cloud Storage + Firestore metadata architecture
- [ ] Create basic Content entity with TypeScript types
- [ ] Add authentication middleware to content endpoints
- [ ] Use visual markdown editor (mdx-editor recommended)
- [ ] Implement basic auto-save functionality
- [ ] Add basic loading states and error handling
- [ ] Ensure proper route protection for content pages

### Task 6: Final Polish & E2E Testing

- [ ] **Implementation**
    - Add proper error handling and user feedback
    - Run quality verification scripts
    - Fix any critical issues
- [ ] **Testing**
    - E2E test for complete note creation/editing flow
- [ ] **Documentation**
    - Update README with basic content features

## Notes

### Technical Architecture

- **Storage**: Firestore metadata + Cloud Storage content (1000x cost savings)
- **Editor**: mdx-editor for visual markdown editing (no raw markdown)
- **Caching**: Client-side caching with intelligent invalidation
- **Auto-save**: 3-second debounced auto-save with user feedback

### Future Iterations

- **Iteration 2**: Individual flashcards + simple study feature
- **Iteration 3**: Child directories + content organization
- **Iteration 4**: Flashcard decks + attachments
- **Iteration 5**: Tags + search functionality

### Success Metrics

- Users can create and edit notes immediately after login
- Content loads in < 2 seconds, editor opens in < 1 second
- Zero data loss with reliable auto-save
- Cost tracking shows efficient resource usage

### Risk Mitigation

- Start with simple markdown editor, enhance gradually
- Implement aggressive caching for performance
- Graceful error handling prevents user content loss
- Clear user feedback for all operations

# Story 43: Setup Production Environment

## Description

As a developer, I want to finalize production environment configuration and deployment so that I can deploy the application to the live production environment with confidence and proper security measures.

**Goal**: Finalize production environment configuration and deployment.

This is the sixth phase of the multi-environment setup and establishes the live production environment.

## User Story

```
As a developer
I want a properly configured production environment
So that I can deploy the application to live users
With proper security, monitoring, and reliability measures
```

## Business Value

- **Live Application**: Enables deployment to real users in production
- **Security**: Proper production security configuration and access controls
- **Reliability**: Production-grade configuration for stability and performance
- **Monitoring**: Foundation for production monitoring and error handling

## Technical Requirements

- Production Firebase project with enterprise-grade configuration
- Maximum security and access controls
- Production-grade performance and reliability settings
- Proper monitoring and error handling
- Secure environment variable and configuration management

## Tasks

### Firebase Project Setup for Production

- [ ] Verify `sapie-prod` project exists and is properly configured
- [ ] Enable Authentication (Email/Password, Google) for `sapie-prod`
- [ ] Configure authorized domains for production environment
- [ ] Set up Firebase Hosting for `sapie-prod` with custom domain if applicable
- [ ] Configure Firebase Functions for `sapie-prod` with production settings
- [ ] Set up Firestore database with production security rules
- [ ] Configure Firebase Storage for `sapie-prod` with production security

### Environment Configuration

- [ ] Create `.env.production` for production environment
- [ ] Update Firebase configuration for production
- [ ] Update `.firebaserc` with `prod` alias pointing to `sapie-prod`
- [ ] Ensure secure configuration (no sensitive data in version control)
- [ ] Configure production-specific environment variables securely

### Build Scripts and Deployment

- [ ] Add `build:prod` script for production environment deployment
- [ ] Add `deploy:prod` script for production deployment
- [ ] Add comprehensive environment validation before production deployment
- [ ] Add production deployment safety checks
- [ ] Create production deployment runbook and procedures

### Testing and Validation

- [ ] Test deployment to production environment
- [ ] Verify all functionality in production environment
- [ ] Test production monitoring and error handling
- [ ] Validate security configuration in production
- [ ] Document production deployment and rollback procedures

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `sapie-prod` Firebase project is properly configured for production
- [ ] All Firebase services are configured with production security settings
- [ ] Web application deploys successfully to production
- [ ] API deploys successfully to production with proper security
- [ ] Authentication works securely in production
- [ ] Content management works reliably in production
- [ ] Environment has maximum security configuration
- [ ] Deployment process includes safety checks and validation
- [ ] Production monitoring and error handling is configured
- [ ] Rollback procedures are documented and tested

## Dependencies

- **Story 42**: Staging environment as final validation
- **Story 41**: Development environment as reference
- Access to Firebase Console with production permissions
- Production domain and SSL certificate (if applicable)
- Team access controls and security policies

## Notes

- Production environment requires maximum security and reliability
- Consider implementing deployment approval processes
- Monitor Firebase quotas and billing carefully for production
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Document production support and incident response procedures
- Consider backup and disaster recovery procedures

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All tasks completed and tested
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated and reviewed
- [ ] Production environment fully deployed and secured
- [ ] Story acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Environment ready for live production deployment

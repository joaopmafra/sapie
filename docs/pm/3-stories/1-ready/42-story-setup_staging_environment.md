# Story 42: Setup Staging Environment

## Description

As a developer, I want to set up a pre-production testing environment so that I can perform comprehensive testing and validation before production deployments.

**Goal**: Set up pre-production testing environment.

This is the fifth phase of the multi-environment setup and provides a production-like environment for final testing before production releases.

## User Story

```
As a developer
I want a staging environment that mirrors production
So that I can perform final testing and validation
Before deploying changes to the live production environment
```

## Business Value

- **Production Validation**: Final testing in production-like environment
- **Risk Mitigation**: Catch issues before they reach production
- **Stakeholder Review**: Safe environment for stakeholder testing and approval
- **Release Confidence**: Increased confidence in production deployments

## Technical Requirements

- Real Firebase project configured identically to production
- All Firebase services enabled and configured for pre-production testing
- Environment should mirror production configuration
- Deployment processes should match production procedures
- Comprehensive testing capabilities

## Tasks

### Firebase Project Setup for Staging

- [ ] Create `sapie-staging` project for staging environment
- [ ] Enable Authentication (Email/Password, Google) for `sapie-staging`
- [ ] Configure authorized domains for staging environment
- [ ] Set up Firebase Hosting for `sapie-staging`
- [ ] Configure Firebase Functions for `sapie-staging`
- [ ] Set up Firestore database with production-like configuration
- [ ] Configure Firebase Storage for `sapie-staging`

### Environment Configuration

- [ ] Create `.env.staging` for staging environment
- [ ] Update Firebase configuration for staging
- [ ] Update `.firebaserc` with `staging` alias pointing to `sapie-staging`
- [ ] Ensure staging configuration mirrors production setup
- [ ] Configure environment-specific variables for staging

### Build Scripts and Deployment

- [ ] Add `build:staging` script for staging environment deployment
- [ ] Add `deploy:staging` script for staging deployment
- [ ] Add staging-specific deployment validation
- [ ] Ensure deployment process matches production procedures
- [ ] Create staging deployment workflow documentation

### Testing and Validation

- [ ] Test deployment to staging environment
- [ ] Run comprehensive testing in staging environment
- [ ] Verify production-like functionality in staging
- [ ] Test authentication and user management in staging
- [ ] Validate content management operations in staging
- [ ] Document staging environment usage and testing procedures

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `sapie-staging` Firebase project is created and configured
- [ ] Staging environment mirrors production configuration
- [ ] All Firebase services work identically to production
- [ ] Web application deploys successfully to staging
- [ ] API deploys successfully to staging
- [ ] Authentication works with real Firebase Auth in staging
- [ ] Content management works completely in staging
- [ ] Environment is isolated from development and production
- [ ] Deployment process is documented and repeatable
- [ ] Staging serves as final validation before production

## Dependencies

- **Feature 5**: Multiple Environments Setup (parent feature)
- **Story 41**: Development environment as template and reference
- Access to Firebase Console for project creation
- Understanding of production configuration requirements
- Team Firebase account with appropriate permissions

## Notes

- Staging should be as close to production as possible
- Environment should support comprehensive user acceptance testing
- Consider implementing automated testing against staging
- Monitor resource usage and costs for staging environment
- Document any differences from production (if any)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All tasks completed and tested
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated and reviewed
- [ ] Staging environment fully deployed and validated
- [ ] Story acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Environment ready for pre-production testing workflows

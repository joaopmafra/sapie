## **Benefits of This Breakdown:**

1. **Manageable Size**: Each story is focused and can be completed independently
2. **Clear Dependencies**: Stories have clear dependency relationships
3. **Incremental Value**: Each story delivers specific user value
4. **Better Testing**: Smaller scope allows for more thorough testing
5. **Parallel Development**: Some stories can be developed in parallel after the foundation

## **Development Order:**
1. **Start with Story #6** (core login/logout) - This is the foundation
2. **Stories #14 and #16** can be developed in parallel after #6
3. **Story #15** (API auth) can be developed independently and integrated later

This approach makes the authentication implementation much more manageable and allows for better project planning and execution!

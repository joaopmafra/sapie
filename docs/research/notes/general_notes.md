Set up Firebase configuration for authentication and data storage?
Create the notes feature with a rich text editor?
Implement the flashcards feature with spaced repetition?
Set up the quiz system?
Add more UI components or styling?

Next steps I recommend:
Set up Firebase configuration for both frontend and backend
Create the basic data models for notes and flashcards
Implement authentication
Create the basic UI components for notes and flashcards
Set up the spaced repetition algorithm
Would you like me to help you with any of these next steps?


I'm planning to create a knowledge management app. Basically it will have features for creating and organizing notes in a structured way, quizzes, flash cards and spaced repetition. The app should run as web app and as mobile app as well. The app will be developed using React as the main front end technology and should be deployed to Google Firebase platform. Which frameworks are recommended for such an app?

# Content Features - First Iteration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the first iteration of content features implementation following the **iterative development
approach** (scooter → bicycle → motorcycle → car). This iteration represents the "scooter" - a complete, working
solution that provides immediate value to users.

## Iteration Goals

**Core User Need**: Users need a simple way to create, edit, and organize their study notes digitally.

**Value Proposition**: Users can immediately start taking notes in a structured environment, replacing scattered text
files or paper notes with a centralized digital solution.

**Full-Stack Philosophy**: Each story delivers complete user workflows from UI interaction to data persistence, providing immediate user value.

## Scope Definition

### ✅ Included in This Iteration

1. **Complete Root Directory Workflow (Story 31)**
    - Automatically created "My Contents" directory for each authenticated user
    - Full-stack implementation: backend storage + frontend display
    - User sees their personal workspace immediately upon login
    - Foundation for all content management

2. **Complete Note Management Workflow (Story 32)**
    - Create new notes with title and markdown content (full UI to storage)
    - Edit existing notes with visual markdown editor and auto-save
    - Delete notes with confirmation modal
    - List all notes with previews and management options
    - End-to-end note-taking experience

3. **Essential User Experience Features**
   - Simple user onboarding with helpful empty states

## Story-Driven Implementation

### Story 31: Create and Display User's Root Directory
**User Value**: Users see their personal workspace immediately upon login
**Implementation**: Full-stack story delivering complete workflow
- Backend: Root directory creation, Firestore integration, API endpoint
- Frontend: Content workspace page, authentication integration, navigation
- **Complete Workflow**: Login → See "My Contents" → Ready to create content

### Story 32: Create and Edit Notes  
**User Value**: Users can immediately start taking and managing notes
**Implementation**: Full-stack story delivering complete note-taking experience
- Backend: Cloud Storage, metadata service, complete CRUD API
- Frontend: Note creation modal, markdown editor, note list, auto-save
- **Complete Workflow**: Create Note → Edit Content → Auto-save → Manage Notes

## Technical Architecture

### Full-Stack Integration Approach

Rather than splitting backend and frontend into separate stories, each story implements complete user workflows:

- **Immediate User Value**: Users can accomplish real tasks upon story completion
- **End-to-End Testing**: Complete workflows can be tested and validated
- **Faster Feedback**: Users experience the full feature immediately
- **Reduced Coordination**: No waiting for backend/frontend story dependencies

### Data Model

**User Root Directory (Firestore)**

```typescript
{
    id: "root_user_123",
    name: "My Contents",
    type: "directory",
    parentId: null, // Root directory
    ownerId: "user_123",
    createdAt: timestamp,
    updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

**Note Metadata (Firestore)**

```typescript
{
    id: "note_456",
    name: "Study Notes - Chapter 1",
    type: "note",
    parentId: "root_user_123",
    ownerId: "user_123",
    contentUrl: "gs://sapie-content/user_123/notes/note_456.md",
    size: 2048, // bytes
    createdAt: timestamp,
    updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

**Note Content (Cloud Storage)**

- Stored as markdown files in Cloud Storage
- Path: `/user_123/notes/note_456.md`
- Accessed via signed URLs

### Storage Strategy

Following the **Cloud Storage + Firestore metadata** decision:

- **Firestore**: Metadata only (fast queries, low cost)
- **Cloud Storage**: Actual content (1000x cheaper storage)
- **Access**: Signed URLs for secure content delivery
- **Caching**: Aggressive client-side caching of both metadata and content

### API Design

```typescript
// Root directory management
GET /api/content/root              // Get or create user's root directory

// Note CRUD operations
POST /api/content                  // Create new note
GET /api/content/:id               // Get note metadata
PUT /api/content/:id               // Update note
DELETE /api/content/:id            // Delete note
GET /api/content/:id/download      // Get signed URL for note content
GET /api/content/:id/children      // List notes in directory
```

## User Experience Flow

### First Time User Experience

1. **User logs in** → Authentication completes
2. **Story 31 delivers**: User immediately sees "My Contents" directory
3. **User clicks "Create Note"** → CreateNoteModal opens
4. **User enters title** → Note created, editor opens automatically
5. **Story 32 delivers**: User can immediately start typing and see auto-save
6. **User returns to workspace** → Sees note listed with preview

### Returning User Experience

1. **User logs in** → Loads "My Contents" directory with existing notes
2. **User sees note list** → All notes displayed with previews and metadata
3. **User clicks note** → Editor opens with content loaded
4. **User edits content** → Auto-saves every 3 seconds with visual feedback
5. **User can manage notes** → Delete with confirmation, organize by titles

### Complete User Workflows

- **Create Workflow**: Click Create → Enter Title → Start Typing → Auto-save
- **Edit Workflow**: Click Note → Edit Content → See Save Status → Auto-save
- **Manage Workflow**: View List → See Previews → Delete with Confirmation
- **Navigate Workflow**: Workspace ↔ Editor with clear breadcrumbs

## Implementation Benefits

### Advantages of Full-Stack Stories

1. **Immediate User Value**: Users can complete real tasks after each story
2. **Reduced Risk**: Complete workflows are tested and validated early
3. **Better User Feedback**: Users experience the full feature immediately
4. **Faster Development**: No coordination overhead between backend/frontend
5. **Clear Success Criteria**: Complete user workflows are easily measurable

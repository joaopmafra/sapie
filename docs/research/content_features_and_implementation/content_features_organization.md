## Key Implementation Principles

### 1. Complete Solutions Per Story

- Each story must deliver a working, deployable solution
- No partial implementations or incomplete features
- Users must get immediate value from each story completion

### 2. Full-Stack Implementation

- Implement complete user workflows (UI + API + storage) in single stories
- Don't split backend and frontend into separate stories unless absolutely necessary
- Each story should contribute to a working end-to-end feature

### 3. Iterative Enhancement

- Each iteration builds upon the previous one
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Plan upgrade paths between iterations

### 4. User-Centric Approach

- Start with core user needs
- Validate assumptions early with complete workflows
- Get feedback after each story completion

## Remember: Full-Stack Story Success

**"Users prefer a working scooter today over a promised car next month."**

Each story must deliver complete user value through full-stack implementation. Rather than building incomplete backend
APIs or frontend components, we build complete user workflows that solve real problems immediately. This approach
ensures:

- Users get immediate value
- We get early feedback on complete features
- Development moves faster with less coordination overhead
- Success criteria are clear and measurable
- Risk is reduced through early validation

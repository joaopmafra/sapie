## Key Implementation Principles

### 1. Complete Solutions Per Iteration
- Each iteration must deliver a working, deployable solution
- No partial implementations or incomplete features
- Users must get immediate value from each iteration

### 2. Build End-to-End
- Implement full stack (API + UI + storage) for each feature
- Don't build incomplete backend without frontend
- Each story should contribute to a working feature

### 3. Iterative Enhancement
- Each iteration builds upon the previous one
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Plan upgrade paths between iterations

### 4. User-Centric Approach
- Start with core user needs
- Validate assumptions early
- Get feedback after each iteration

## Success Metrics

### Iteration 1 Metrics
- Users create ≥3 notes within first week
- Session time >10 minutes
- User retention >60% after first week
- Zero data loss incidents

### Iteration 2 Metrics
- Users create ≥5 flashcards within first week
- Study session completion rate >70%
- Users return to study within 3 days

### Iteration 3 Metrics
- Users create ≥2 directories within first week
- Content organization usage >50%
- Navigation efficiency improves

### Iteration 4 Metrics
- Spaced repetition engagement >80%
- Study performance improvement measurable
- Long-term retention >70%

### Iteration 5 Metrics
- Search usage >60% of active users
- Content discovery time reduces by 50%
- Tag usage >40% of users

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Editor Integration**: Start simple, enhance gradually
- **Auto-save Performance**: Implement debouncing and caching
- **Storage Costs**: Monitor and optimize continuously
- **Spaced Repetition Complexity**: Use proven algorithms

### User Experience Risks
- **Learning Curve**: Simple, intuitive interfaces
- **Data Loss Fears**: Visible save indicators
- **Feature Complexity**: Progressive disclosure
- **Empty State Confusion**: Clear onboarding

### Business Risks
- **User Adoption**: Deploy early, get feedback
- **Cost Scaling**: Monitor per-user costs
- **Competition**: Focus on unique value proposition
- **Technical Debt**: Maintain code quality standards

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Story 31**: Implement Content Storage Foundation
2. **Complete Feature 26**: Basic Note Management (Iteration 1)
3. **Validate with Users**: Get feedback on first iteration
4. **Plan Iteration 2**: Based on user feedback and learnings
5. **Continue Iterative Development**: Following this roadmap

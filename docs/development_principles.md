# Development Principles

This document outlines the core development principles used throughout the Sapie project to maintain code quality, consistency, and maintainability.

## Core Principles

We follow these fundamental development principles throughout the codebase:

### Make it work, make it right, make it fast
- ✅ **Make it work** - Get the basic functionality working first
- ✅ **Make it right** - Clean up and improve after the feature works
- ✅ **Make it fast** - Optimize for performance when there's a proven issue

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- ✅ **Prefer simple solutions** - Choose the most straightforward approach that meets requirements
- ✅ **Avoid over-engineering** - Don't add complexity for hypothetical future needs
- ✅ **Write readable code** - Code should be self-documenting and easy to understand
- ✅ **Small functions/components** - Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- ❌ **Don't build complex abstractions** unless there's clear, immediate value

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- ✅ **Extract common logic** - Create reusable functions, components, or utilities
- ✅ **Use consistent patterns** - Follow established patterns throughout the codebase
- ✅ **Centralize configuration** - Keep configuration in one place (environment variables, constants)
- ✅ **Share types and interfaces** - Use TypeScript types consistently across packages
- ❌ **Don't copy-paste code** - If you need the same logic twice, create a shared utility

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- ✅ **Implement only what's needed** - Build features only when they're actually required
- ✅ **Focus on current story requirements** - Don't add features not specified in the story
- ✅ **Avoid premature optimization** - Optimize only when there's a proven performance issue
- ❌ **Don't build for "future requirements"** - Wait until requirements are concrete

### Single Responsibility Principle
- ✅ **One purpose per function** - Each function should do one thing well
- ✅ **One concern per component** - React components should have a single responsibility
- ✅ **Focused modules** - Each module should have a clear, single purpose
- ✅ **Separated concerns** - Keep business logic separate from UI logic

## Application in Story Implementation

### When Implementing Features
1. **Start with the simplest solution** - Get the basic functionality working first
2. **Refactor if needed** - Clean up and improve after the feature works
3. **Extract reusable parts** - If you notice duplication, create shared utilities
4. **Keep functions small** - If a function is getting long, break it down

### When Writing Tests
1. **Test behavior, not implementation** - Focus on what the code does, not how
2. **Keep tests simple** - Each test should verify one specific behavior
3. **Use descriptive test names** - Test names should clearly describe what's being tested
4. **Avoid testing implementation details** - Test the public interface

### When Writing Documentation
1. **Document the "why", not just the "what"** - Explain the reasoning behind decisions
2. **Keep documentation close to code** - Document complex logic inline
3. **Update docs with code changes** - Keep documentation current
4. **Use clear, simple language** - Write for developers who will maintain the code

## TypeScript-Specific Principles

### Type Safety
- ✅ **Use strict types** - Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- ✅ **Create meaningful interfaces** - Define clear contracts between components
- ✅ **Use union types** - Prefer union types over generic objects
- ✅ **Leverage type inference** - Let TypeScript infer types when possible

### Code Organization
- ✅ **Co-locate related types** - Keep types near the code that uses them
- ✅ **Use barrel exports** - Create clean public APIs for modules
- ✅ **Consistent naming** - Use consistent naming conventions for types and interfaces

## Firebase-Specific Principles

### Authentication
- ✅ **Use Firebase Auth consistently** - Don't mix authentication methods
- ✅ **Handle auth states properly** - Always handle loading, authenticated, and unauthenticated states
- ✅ **Secure by default** - Assume endpoints need authentication unless explicitly public

### Data Management
- ✅ **Use Firebase services appropriately** - Use the right Firebase service for each use case
- ✅ **Handle offline scenarios** - Consider what happens when Firebase services are unavailable
- ✅ **Optimize for Firebase** - Structure data and queries to work efficiently with Firebase

## Code Review Principles

When reviewing code (or self-reviewing):
1. **Is it simple and easy to understand?** (KISS)
2. **Does it avoid unnecessary duplication?** (DRY)
3. **Does it only implement what's needed?** (YAGNI)
4. **Does each part have a single responsibility?** (SRP)
5. **Are there proper tests for the functionality, if possible?**
6. **Is the documentation updated?**

## Questions?

For questions about applying these principles:

1. **Check the [Contributing Guidelines](contributing_guidelines.md)** - See how principles integrate with the development workflow
2. **Review existing code** - Look at how principles are applied in the current codebase
3. **Ask the team** - When in doubt about how to apply a principle in a specific situation

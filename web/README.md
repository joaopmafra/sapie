# Sapie Web Application

This is a React application built with Vite and MUI component library.

## Development

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the built application.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

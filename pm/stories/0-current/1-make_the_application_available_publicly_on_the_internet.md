# Make the application publicly available on the internet

## Description
As a user, I want to access the application with HTTPS publicly on the internet.

## Details
Host the application on Google Cloud, as a Hosting app. Initially, the app should consist only of a front end app with
a simple home page. The app should use React with Vite and MUI as the component library.
